Installing PyMultiNest and PyCuba
=================================================

.. contents::

You need to install the python module and put the libraries it uses
into your library path.

1. Installing the Python Module
---------------------------------

Installing the python module from PyPI is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip install pymultinest

* Use the "--user" switch if you only want to install the software locally
* On older systems, you may need to use easy_install instead of "pip install"

To get the latest version, download the source directly from the
`Code repository <https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest/>`_
and install it locally:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest/
	$ cd PyMultiNest
	$ python setup.py install


However, installing pymultinest is not enough; MultiNest and Cuba are not included, so you
will see an error like::

	ERROR:   Could not load MultiNest library "libmultinest.so"
	ERROR:   You have to build it first, and point the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to it!

or::

	OSError: libcuba.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You need to install the libraries themselves! The next section explains how.

2. Prerequisites for building the libraries
-------------------------------------------------------

To use PyMultiNest and PyCuba, you need to install the relevant
libraries. If you only want to use one of them, skip the others according.

* Prerequisites: *numpy*, *scipy*, *matplotlib*, c and fortran compilers (e.g. *gcc*, *gfortran*)
* Prerequisites for MultiNest: *cmake*, *blas*, *lapack*, *atlas* (and their development versions)
* Recommended: *git*

On **Ubuntu Linux**, install with:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo apt-get install python-{scipy,numpy,matplotlib,progressbar} ipython libblas{3,-dev} liblapack{3,-dev} libatlas{3-base,-dev} cmake build-essential git gfortran

On **Mac OSX**:

* As in the instructions above, you need cmake and a Fortran compiler.
* If you google for "MultiNest Mac OSX" or "PyMultiNest Mac OSX" you will find installation instructions.

2. Building the libraries
--------------------------------------

* If you want to use :doc:`PyMultiNest <pymultinest>`:

  * Get and compile MultiNest (use the cmake version from `https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest`). The goal is to create lib/libmultinest.so ::
  	
  	git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest
  	cd MultiNest/build
  	cmake ..
  	make

  * Include the lib/ directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  * More detailed install instructions for MultiNest are available in the `tutorial <http://johannesbuchner.github.io/pymultinest-tutorial/install.html#on-your-own-computer>`_.

* If you want to use :doc:`PyCuba <pycuba>`:
  Get and compile `Cuba <http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/>`_. The goal is to create the libcuba.so file ::
  
	git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/cuba/
	cd cuba
	./configure
	./makesharedlib.sh
  
  Include the containing directory your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

* To install on Mac OSX, make sure the multinest/cuba libraries are in your library path. For that, it is simplest to copy them, e.g.::

	$ cp -v ~/Downloads/MultiNest/lib/lib* /anaconda3/lib/

A discussion on installing on Mac can be found in `issue 10 <https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest/issues/10>`_. Compiling with MPI support on Mac is discussed in `issue 45 <https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest/issues/45>`_

3. Running some code
--------------------------

PyMultiNest and PyCuba have to be able to find the corresponding 
libraries. So put the three directories in the dynamic library load path:

.. code-block:: bash

     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/Downloads/MultiNest/lib:$HOME/Downloads/cuba/directory/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Replace the above with your actual path.
* Consider putting this line into your shell startup script (e.g. ~/.bashrc).

Test importing the libraries:

.. code-block:: bash

     $ python -c 'import pymultinest'
     $ python -c 'import pycuba'

Try out the demo programs distributed in the package:

.. code-block:: bash

     $ python $OLDPWD/pymultinest_demo.py
        ....

Congratulations! You are now ready to run your own code. Copy the demo files as starting points, play with the functions and analysis, and integrate it to your own code. The documentation should help you:

* Continue with :doc:`PyMultiNest documentation <pymultinest>`
* Continue with :doc:`PyCuba documentation <pycuba>`
