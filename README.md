# CANDELS SED-fitting
This is the project for running the SED fitting code from BAGPIPES on CANDELS catalogs. It can run multiple models and divide the catalog between the CPU cores.

## Contents:
There are few `bash` scripts inside the `Cluster_bagpipes_script/setup_scripts`
to install the necessary libraries for running the bagpipes on the Linux Debian 9
Google Cloud Computing instances.
